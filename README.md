```
4. On installation complete, generate your `tru.json` config file by running the command below on your command prompt `windows` users or terminal for `mac` users.

```bash
tru projects:create truid-challenge
```

5. Clone the `truid-challenge` repository by running the command below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmanueletukudo/truid-challenge.git
```
6. Install dependencies for the server and client: `npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..`

## Development

### Running the Client & Server

For development build run the command below:

```bash
npm run dev

[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[0] [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[0] [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[0] [nodemon] starting `node src/index.js`

Applocation is listening at 5000
[1] Browserslist: caniuse-lite is outdated. Please run:
[1] npx browserslist@latest --update-db
[1] ready - started server on http://localhost:3000
[1] event - compiled successfully
```
You can hold the command and click on the `http://localhost:3000` to launch the application. You should have a web page similar to the screenshots above. Note: All commands assumes you are in the application's root folder.

### Testing
The test files for the frontend can be found in `test` folder in the client directory. Similarly, the test files for endpoints can be found in `test` folder in the root directory of the application.

1. To run the test for the frontend `cd` into the client directory and run the command below:

```bash
npm run test
```
2. To run the test for the backend run the command below:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Production Usage

To view the production build run the command below:

```bash
npm start
```
Response:

```
> node src/index.js

Application is listening at 5000
```
Visit `http://localhost:5000` on your preferred browser to view the application.


## Deployment
To prepare the application for deployment, follow the steps below:
1. `CD` into the client folder and run the `npm run build` in the terminal for `mac` users and command prompt for `windows` users.
2. Run `npm run prod` to export the application to static HTML and Javascript, the exported files can be found in the out folder.

3. Chose a cloud hosting server to deploy your app to,  in my case `Heruku`.

4. Connect your `giHub` to the `Heruku`.

5. Publish your app. Happy Hacking.
